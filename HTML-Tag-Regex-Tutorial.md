# Understanding the HTML Tag Regex

HTML, is without a doubt the backbone of web pages; it is made up of various elements, which are often represented by tags. Web developers sometimes need to parse, sometimes extract, or validate HTML content. This is the main reason where regular expressions come in handy. This tutorial aims to dissect a specific regex that matches an HTML tag, helping you understand its components and how it works.

## Summary

The regex that we're exploring in this tutorial is used to match HTML tags. It's particularly crafted to identify both self-closing tags (<img src="image.jpg" />) and paired tags (<div>content</div>). 

Here's the regex pattern that we will be looking in this tutorial:

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The "^" and "$" are anchor characters: /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

^ marks the position at the start of a line.
$ marks the position at the end of a line.
But when they are together, they ensure that the pattern matches an entire line: from start to finish.

### Quantifiers

+: This one matches the preceding element one or more times.
*: and this one matches the preceding element zero or more times.

### Grouping Constructs

There are several groups in our regex, we're going to paste it again for quick reference /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/:

([a-z]+): This one matches one or more lowercase letters. In this case, it captures the tag name.
([^<]+)*: This matches any sequence of characters except "<", and it's used to capture tag attributes.
(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>): Finally, this is a non-capturing group, denoted by (?:...). Within it, we have two patterns separated by the OR operator (|):

The first pattern matches content between paired tags, and the second pattern matches self-closing tags.

### Bracket Expressions

Like we said in grouping constructs, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'; on the other hand, [^<]: matches any character that is not a <.

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

The "|" character represents the OR operator, like we anticipated earlier. It allows the regex to match one of several patterns. In our regex, it differentiates between paired tags and self-closing tags.

### Flags

### Character Escapes
